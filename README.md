### Abstract of the paper

During the last ten years advances in open-source digital technology led to very accessible ways to obtain, store, process, share or present data in almost every human activity. Open data and analysis as key components of open science can not only bring transparency, accessibility, and reproducibility in education research, but also give benefits to teachers themselves in improving effectiveness of teaching and learning.

Our research in the framework of the mixed-method approach examines physics teachers' perception of open-source Jupyter and R Shiny technology in three groups: Ph.D. candidates in physics education research (PER), pre-service and in-service physics teachers in Slovakia.

The results suggest that in-service teachers are still not prepared for open analysis, but positively accept open education data presented via R Shiny interactive web application as an important form of the immediate feedback about the quality of their practice. 

Simultaneously results also indicate that young beginning PER researchers and pre-service physics teachers can master key skills to work with Jupyter technology with satisfaction appreciating its big impact and potential in their learning, data literacy or professional development.

**At the moment Jupyter notebooks do not work due to some technical problems with incompatibility of some R libraries. We are working very hard to remove this problem**.

The notebooks folders ([`UEQ`](UEQ), [`CaseStudies`](CaseStudies)) contain R based Jupyter notebooks which are detailed records of our open data analysis with explaining narratives ilustrating explored concepts and methods. 

Notebooks can be studied and **viewed** statically in [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) [![render in nbviewer](misc/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fdslrm/EBLUP-NE/blob/master/index.ipynb) with full visualisation. If there is a need, they can be also viewed directly on Github [`index.ipynb`](index.ipynb), also as a raw code. 

For interactive **executing** notebooks as live documents without any need to install or compile the software,
**use** the following link

There is also another very comfort alternative, fully tested by us, [Google Drive Colaboratory](https://) providing interactive computing with our Jupyter notebooks.
