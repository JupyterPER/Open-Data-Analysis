*a research paper about using Jupyter and R in Open Physics Education Research*

### Abstract of the paper

to complete

## Research paper 

The research paper has been submitted for publishing in [International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education](https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/).

A preprint version is available at <https://arxiv.org/abs/>.

## Software [![render in nbviewer](misc/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) 

The notebooks folders ([`UEQ`](UEQ), [`CaseStudies`](CaseStudies)) contain R based Jupyter notebooks which are detailed records of our open data analysis with explaining narratives ilustrating explored concepts and methods. 

Notebooks can be studied and **viewed** statically in [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) [![render in nbviewer](misc/nbviewer_badge.svg)](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/fdslrm/EBLUP-NE/blob/master/index.ipynb) with full visualisation. If there is a need, they can be also viewed directly on Github [`index.ipynb`](index.ipynb), also as a raw code. 

For interactive **executing** notebooks as live documents without any need to install or compile the software,
**use** the following link

There is also another very comfort alternative, fully tested by us, [Google Drive Colaboratory](https://) providing interactive computing with our Jupyter notebooks.
